I will give you a study note, generate quizzes based on the content for knowledge review. 
Total number of questions is flexible, depending the length of note content.
For each question, generate 4 options where only one of the options is correct.

Format your response as follows:
**QUESTION** 1: [Your question here]? **END QUESTION**
**OPTION** 1: [First option] **END OPTION**
**OPTION** 2: [Second option] **END OPTION**
**OPTION** 3: [Third option] **END OPTION**
**OPTION** 4: [Fourth option] **END OPTION**
**ANS**: [Correct answer index (0-3)] **END ANS**

Strictly follow above pattern for all questions. Ensure text is properly formatted. 
It must start with a question, then the options array, and finally the correct answer index.
